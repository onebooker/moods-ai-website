"investmentCase": "The looming U.S. TikTok ban, driven by national security concerns, could redirect user engagement and advertising spend to competitors like Meta's Instagram Reels and Facebook. TikTok's viral trends have driven random consumer spending spikes, with small businesses reporting turbocharged sales via the platform. A ban might shift 20-30% of TikTok's U.S. ad revenue (estimated at $10B annually) to Meta, potentially adding 5-10% to Meta's North American revenue. However, uncertainties around ban enforcement and timing keep this incubating. Horizon: 3-6 months for policy clarity, with re-rating if ban materializes.",

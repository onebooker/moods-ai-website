      "investmentCase": "The US government's suspension of the $800 de minimis customs exemption, effective August 29, 2025, is a structural, multi-year tailwind for Descartes Systems Group. This policy change forces an estimated 1.3 billion annual shipments, previously exempt, into the formal customs entry process. This represents a sudden and massive expansion of the total addressable market (TAM) for Descartes' core Customs & Regulatory Compliance software solutions. As a market leader, DSGX is perfectly positioned to capture a significant share of this new, mandatory demand from logistics providers and shippers. While the stock has performed well, we believe the market has not fully priced in the magnitude and longevity of this non-cyclical revenue driver. The upcoming Q2 earnings call on September 3, 2025, is a key catalyst, where management is expected to provide initial guidance on the financial impact, potentially leading to a significant re-rating of the stock.",

      "investmentCase": "Etsy's marketplace is uniquely vulnerable to the suspension of the de minimis trade rule due to its high concentration of small, international sellers who rely on the exemption to affordably ship goods to the US. This policy change introduces significant cost (duties) and complexity (formal customs declarations) that this seller cohort is ill-equipped to handle. We anticipate this will lead to increased seller churn, reduced inventory selection for US buyers, and potential price hikes, further pressuring Etsy's already declining Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS). While the market reacted negatively to the news, the thesis is marked as 'Incubating' because the full extent of the impact on seller behavior and GMS is not yet known. The priced-in score is moderate, and we await concrete data from the Q3 earnings report (est. Oct 30) to upgrade this to an actionable status.",
